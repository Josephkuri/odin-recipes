<h1>Instructions</h1>
<ol>
    <h2>Prepare the Rice</h2>
</ol>
<p>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well and set aside.</p>
<ol><h2>Prepare the Meat</h2></ol>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the cooking oil or ghee in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic, ginger paste, cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h2>Cook the Meat</h2>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Add the cubed chicken thighs or beef stew meat to the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h2>Add Spices</h2>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, and paprika (if using). Mix well to coat the meat and onions with the spices.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h2>Add Rice and Broth</h2>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Add the rinsed basmati rice to the pot. Stir gently to combine with the meat and spices.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken or beef broth, ensuring the rice is submerged in the liquid.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h2>Simmer</h2>
</ol>
<ol>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and liquid is absorbed. Avoid stirring the rice during this time to prevent it from becoming sticky.</ol>
<ol>
    <h2>Fluff and Serve</h2>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fluff the pilau gently with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro or parsley before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pilau is traditionally served hot as a main dish, often accompanied by a side of salad, yogurt, or a vegetable dish. Enjoy the delightful blend of spices and tender meat in this comforting rice dish</p>
