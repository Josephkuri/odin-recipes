<p>Ugali and Beef is a quintessential East African dish, cherished for its comforting simplicity and robust flavors. The dish combines two main components: Ugali, a staple made from maize flour and water, cooked to a thick, hearty consistency; and Beef Stew, featuring tender chunks of beef simmered in a savory blend of onions, tomatoes, garlic, and aromatic spices like curry powder and paprika. </p>
<p>The slow-cooking process ensures the meat is succulent and infused with rich flavors, creating a delicious contrast to the subtly sweet and satisfying Ugali. Garnished with fresh herbs, this dish is a wholesome meal that brings together the heartiness of African cuisine with an inviting, communal dining experience.</p>

    <li>1 liter water</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
<h2>For Beef Stew</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500 g beef stew meat, cubed</li>
    <li>30 ml cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>10 grams ginger, minced</li>
    <li>5 grams curry powder</li>
    <li>5 grams paprika</li>
    <li>2 grams cumin powder</li>

    <li>500 ml beef broth or water</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h2>Prepare the Ugali</h2></li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>In a large saucepan, bring 1 liter of water to a boil.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the maize flour while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and continue stirring until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cover the saucepan with a lid and let the Ugali steam for another 5-10 minutes to cook through.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, while you prepare the beef stew.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li><h2>Make the Beef Stew</h2></li>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and saut√© until they become translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the cubed beef to the skillet and brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, curry powder, paprika, cumin powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes soften.</li>
        <li>Pour in the beef broth or water, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to prevent sticking.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h2>Serve</h2>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>To serve, scoop a portion of Ugali onto a plate or bowl.</li>
        <li>Ladle the beef stew over the Ugali.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
